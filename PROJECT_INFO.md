### Scroll-Triggered Animations
- Elements animate when they enter the viewport
- Uses Intersection Observer API for performance
- Configurable animation styles (fade-in-up, fade-in-left, etc.)

### Pre-built Animation Classes
- `animate-fade-in-up` - Fades in while moving up
- `animate-fade-in-down` - Fades in while moving down
- `animate-fade-in-left` - Fades in from left
- `animate-fade-in-right` - Fades in from right
- `animate-scale-in` - Fades in with scale effect
- `animate-float` - Continuous floating motion
- `animate-glow` - Glowing shadow effect

### Staggered Animations
- Sequential animations with `.stagger-1` to `.stagger-6` classes
- Creates cascading effect for lists and grids

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

1. Extract the project files
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

### Development

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
# or
pnpm build
```

## 🎯 Customization

### Changing Colors

Edit the CSS variables in `src/index.css` in the `:root` and `.dark` sections:

```css
:root {
  --primary: 210 100% 45%;
  --secondary: 200 40% 35%;
  --accent: 45 100% 50%;
  /* ... more colors ... */
}
```

### Modifying Animations

All animations are defined in `src/index.css` using `@keyframes`. You can customize:
- Duration (currently 0.6s)
- Easing (currently ease-out)
- Transform values (currently 30px)

### Adding New Sections

1. Create a new component in `src/components/`
2. Use the `useScrollAnimation` hook for scroll effects
3. Import and add to `App.jsx`

## 📞 Content Areas to Update

Replace the following with your actual content:
- Company details in Header
- Contact information in Contact section
- Service descriptions in Services section
- Testimonials in Testimonials component
- Social media links in Footer

## 🌐 Responsive Breakpoints

- Mobile: < 640px
- Tablet: 640px - 1024px
- Desktop: > 1024px

All components are optimized for these breakpoints using Tailwind's responsive prefixes.

## 🎬 Animation Performance

- Uses CSS animations for better performance
- Intersection Observer API for efficient scroll detection
- RequestAnimationFrame for smooth parallax effects
- Minimal re-renders with optimized hook usage

## 📝 Notes

- All animations respect user's `prefers-reduced-motion` preference (can be added)
- Loading is optimized with code splitting
- No external API dependencies for basic functionality
- SEO-friendly structure with semantic HTML
